# Smart Gomoku

## Overview

**Smart Gomoku** is a cross-language cross-system **battle platform** with lots of AI agent.

A number of agent algorithms have been implemented, such as **Alpha-Beta Search** (Alpha-Beta Pruning), **MCTS** (Monte Carlo Tree Search), **DNN** (Deep Neural Network), and so on.

## Structure

+ **smart-gomoku-core**: Basic gomoku library.

+ **smart-gomoku-console**: Console is a referee between AI agents. It also sends and receives commands to set up communication with AI agents.

+ **smart-gomoku-dashboard**: Dashboard is a viewer of a situation of chessboard.

+ **smart-gomoku-agent**: Implemented AI agents in arbitrary algorithms in any language.

## Launch Battle Platform
+ ```git clone https://github.com/zhixiangli/smart-gomoku.git```
+ ```cd smart-gomoku```
+ ```sh battle.sh```

## Configuration
**AI Agent** can be changed by modifying the **player.properties**

+ **player.xxxxx.alias**: set an alias to the agent.
+ **player.xxxxx.cmd**: a shell script to start an agent. No agent will start if the command is empty. Every agent should implement the following command.

## Write Your Own AI Agent
The console will create a subprocess for a AI agent.

The communication commands between console and AI agent is by **stdin** and **stdout**

The following is the definition of commands.

Command | Data Flow | Description
--------|-----------|------------
CLEAR | console -> agent | ask the agent to clear the chessboard
NEXT_WHITE | console -> agent | ask the agent to calculate the next move where the white go
NEXT_BLACK | console -> agent | ask the agent to calculate the next move where the black go
RESET ROW COLUMN | console -> agent | ask the agent to reset the chessboard with \$ROW row and \$COLUMN column. There will be \$ROW line following, and each line contains \$COLUMN characters (white: 'W', black: 'B', empty: '.'). **This command is always sent before NEXT_XXXXX command.**
PLAY_BLACK ROW COLUMN | console -> agent | ask agent to put black piece on the position(\$ROW, \$COLUMN) of the chessboard
PLAY_WHITE ROW COLUMN | console -> agent | ask agent to put white piece on the position(\$ROW, \$COLUMN) of the chessboard
PUT ROW COLUMN | agent -> console | ask console to put piece on the position(\$ROW, \$COLUMN) of the chessboard
